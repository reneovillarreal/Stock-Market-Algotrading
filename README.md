## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a day-trading algorithm in the IEX market given a specific set of instructions and restrictions. Each team member was given $100,000 and had the following restrictions in order to avoid penalties: <br>
<br>
1. Trading must be done automatically from an EC2 instance. <br>
2. Can only do two transactions per minute. <br>
3. At least 250 successful trades per day. <br>
4. Maximum of 500 successful trades per day. <br>
5. Trading hours are 9:30AM EST to 4:00PM EST. <br>
6. Only ten trades per symbol per day. <br>
7. Uninvested cash is wiped at the end of each trading day. <br>
<br>
The penalties for having less than 250 transactions was $100 per missed transaction, and the penalties for failed transactions were $1,000 each.
